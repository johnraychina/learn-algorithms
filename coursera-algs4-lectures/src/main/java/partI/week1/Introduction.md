# Welcome to Algorithms, Part I
Thanks for enrolling in our course Algorithms, Part I. 

You can review the syllabus for an overview of the course components. The course is based on a variety of material that we have prepared over many years:

The lecture videos, lecture slides, programming assignments, and "job interview" questions will be released weekly on the course website.

## Our textbook Algorithms, 4th edition 
is the basic reference for the material we will be covering. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we will assign optional readings for students who wish more extensive coverage of the material.


## Our booksite, 
https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/

which is open to everyone and contains a wealth of supplementary information, including synopses of the textbook and Java code that you will be using throughout the course.
To maximize your chance of success in this course, you should get in the mindset of being an active participant who writes and debugs code, solves problems, studies the available resources, and engages in the discussion forums, as opposed to a passive participant who just watches the lectures. You'll get a good feeling for the spirit and pace of the course when you work on the first programming assignment, which will introduce you to our Java programming model in the context of an important scientific application.
