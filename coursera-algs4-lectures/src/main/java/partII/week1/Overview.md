#Overview
We begin our exploration of advanced algorithms by looking at data structures for graphs, which are essential models for a broad variety of real-world problems. A number of classic algorithms are easy to implement, but worthy of careful study both because convincing oneself that they operate as intended can be a challenge and because their performance is strongly dependent on proper use of the basic data structures that we covered in Algorithms Part I.

#Lecture 1: Undirected Graphs. 
We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graphâ€”depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications.

#Lecture 2: Directed Graphs. 
In this lecture we study directed graphs. We begin with depth-first search and breadth-first search in digraphs and describe applications ranging from garbage collection to web crawling. Next, we introduce a depth-first search based algorithm for computing the topological order of an acyclic digraph. Finally, we implement the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph.
