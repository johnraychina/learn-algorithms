 * Patricia trie.
 * Also known as: crit-bit tree, radix tree.
 *
 * 参考：[Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric]
 *
 * ・Remove one-way branching.
 * ・Each node represents a sequence of characters.
 * ・Implementation: one step beyond this course.
 *
 *
 * Applications.
 * ・IP routing tables: find longest prefix match.
 * ・Compressed quad-tree for N-body simulation.
 * ・Efficiently storing and querying XML documents
