/**
 * 中序转换为后序表示 Infix to postfix with precedence order. Write a program to convert an infix expression to postfix. Scan the
 * infix expression from left to right. Operand: output it. Left parentheses: push onto stack. Right parentheses:
 * repeatedly pop elements from the stack and output them until a left parenthesis is encountered. Discard both
 * parentheses. Operator with high precedence than top of stack: push onto stack. Operator with lower or equal
 * precedence than top of stack: repeatedly pop elements from the stack and output them until top of stack has higher
 * precedence. Push the scanned operator onto the stack. Afterward, pop remaining elements off stack and output them.
