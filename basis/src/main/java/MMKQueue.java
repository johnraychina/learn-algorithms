 * 12. 2 M/M/1 queues. Next customer is assigned to the smaller of the two queues. Use 2 FIFO queues. Perception that
 * you always pick the longer line (or wrong lane) when approaching a toll plaza. Suppose two cars enter the toll plaza
 * at the same time and pick different queues of the same length. Compute average length in time that one car will beat
 * the other car by.
 * <p>
 * 13. M/M/k queue. Compare k independent M/M/1 queues vs. M/M/k queue. 14. M/G/1 queue. Analyze queueing model with a
 * different service distribution (G = general).
