Welcome to Week 3 of Analysis of Algorithms. The lecture for this week
introduces classical approximation methods, which are one key to 
understanding our ability to derive concise and precise descriptions of
seemingly-complicated functions that arise in the analysis of algorithms.

---------- 
Lecture 4: Asymptotics. Exact answers are often cumbersome, so we next
consider a scientific approach to developing approximate answers that,
again, mathematicians and scientists have used for centuries.
---------- 

Your assignment for this week, due at 11:59PM on 
     Thursday, February 10, 2022
is to write up and submit solutions to 
     Exercises 4.9, 4.23, 4.38, and 4.71 
in "Analysis of Algorithms" (second edition). There is an error in 4.71
in the text. The version on the booksite is corrected (and simplified).

Also, as mentioned last week, you need to submit a question (with
answer) on the week's material, suitable for use as an assessment
in this course as a part of each assignment from now on.
