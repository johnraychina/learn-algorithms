Welcome to "Introduction to Analytic Combinatorics"

The syllabus for COS 488, the Spring 2022 Princeton offering, are on the 
course homepage https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring22/cos488/

This course is entirely online, with lectures and assignments on
this webpage: https://aofa.cs.princeton.edu/online/. 
If you want to get an early start, you can watch Lecture 0, which 
gives an overview of the course and then describes a case in point that 
illustrates the practical relevance of the course material. 
To watch it, click on the "0. Cardinality Estimation" link in the 
"Lecture Videos" column, which will take you to the CUvids platform 
that serves the videos. Login using your Princeton credentials 
the code "aofapusp2022" to get free access to all the videos
for 2022.

To keep things synchronized, I'll send an e-mail each week (normally on Friday)
describing the lectures and assignments for the week. The first such e-mail 
will come on the first day of classes, next Monday.

We will use the Ed discussion online forum to handle questions and answers 
and the codePost system to handle submissions and grading. You'll be registered
on these platforms soon.

If you know someone who may be interested in shopping the course,
feel free to  pass on this information.
