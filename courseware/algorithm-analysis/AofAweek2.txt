Welcome to Week 2 of Analysis of Algorithms. The lectures for this
week survey basic mathematical tools that have been used for
scientific studies for centuries and are still effective for the
analysis of algorithms.

---------- 
Lecture 2: Recurrences. We begin the course with an
overview of recurrence relations, which provide us with a direct
mathematical model for the analysis of algorithms.  We finish by
examining the fascinating oscillatory behavior of the
divide-and-conquer recurrence corresponding to the mergesort algorithm
and the general "master theorem" for related recurrences.

Lecture 3: Generating Functions. Since the 17th century, scientists
have been using generating functions to solve recurrences, so we
continue with an overview of generating functions, emphasizing their
utility in solving problems like counting the number of binary trees
with N nodes.

Your assignment for this week, due at 11:59PM on 
     Thursday, February 3, 2022
is to write up and submit solutions to 
     Exercises 2.13, 2.17, 3.20, and 3.28 
in "Analysis of Algorithms" (second edition). Please note that
the booksite corrects an error in 2.17 in the book that was discovered
by students during an earlier offering of this course. 
After solving these problems, read the slides in RoadMap.pdf.
Starting this week, you must also create and submit a question (with
answer) on the week's material, suitable for use as an assessment
in this course. RoadMap.pdf gives some examples. 
These questions will count for 10% of your grade.

Finally RoadMap.pdf gives pointers to three movies for your pandemic-viewing
enjoyment that relate strongly to the material in this course.
