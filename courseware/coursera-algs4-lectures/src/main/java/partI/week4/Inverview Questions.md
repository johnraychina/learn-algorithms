# Check if a binary tree is a BST. 
Given a binary tree where each Node contains a key, 
determine whether it is a binary search tree. 
Use extra space proportional to the height of the tree.

Hint: design a recursive function isBST(Node x, Key min, Key max)
that determines whether x is the root of a binary search tree 
with all keys between  min and  max.


# inorder traversal with constant extra space. 
Design an algorithm to perform an inorder traversal of a binary search tree 
using only a constant amount of extra space.


# Web tracking. 
Suppose that you are tracking nn web sites and mm users and you want to support the following API:

User visits a website.
How many times has a given user visited a given site?
What data structure or data structures would you use?


Hint: maintain a symbol table of symbol tables.
