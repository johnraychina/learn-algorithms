图问题：
1. connectivity problems
    - Static connectivity: DFS/BFS for finding connected components
    - Incremental connectivity: Union-Find
    - Decremental connectivity and full dynamic connectivity(非常难，面试一般不会出现)

Examples: 
- friends cycles
- number of islands
- satisfiablility of equality equations
- number of operations to make network connected

- critical edges and cirtical nodes of a graph
    - critical edge: also called bridges (<<Algorithm>>)
    - critical nodes: also called articulation points (<<Algorithm>>)
    - example: Critical connections in a network

- Smallest string  with swaps
- Largest component size by common factor
- Making large island
- Evaluate division
- and more under "union-find" tag in leetcode

2. Shortest path
- Single Source Shortest Path
    - Dijkstra
