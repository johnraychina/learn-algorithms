/**
 * Stack with max.
 * <p>
 * Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum
 * operation. Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them.
 * <p>
 * Hint: Use two stacks, one to store all of the items and a second stack to store the maximums.
