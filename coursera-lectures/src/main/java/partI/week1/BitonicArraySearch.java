/**
 * Search in a bitonic array. An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed
 * immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of nn distinct integer
 * values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Hints: Standard version. First, find the maximum integer using \sim 1 \lg n∼1lgn compares—this divides the array into
 * the increasing and decreasing pieces.
 * <p>
 * Signing bonus. Do it without finding the maximum integer.
