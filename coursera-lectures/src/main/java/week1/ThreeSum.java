/**
 * 3-SUM in quadratic time. Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n^2 in the worst
 * case. You may assume that you can sort the n integers in time proportional to n^2 or better.
 *
 * Hint: given an integer
 * \mathtt{x}x and a sorted array \mathtt{a[ ]}a[] of nn distinct integers, design a linear-time algorithm to determine
 * if there exists two distinct indices \mathtt{i}i and \mathtt{j}j such that \mathtt{a[i] + a[j] == x}a[i]+a[j]==x.
